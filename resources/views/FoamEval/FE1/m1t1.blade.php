    <h1>Foam Concentrate</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        There are several types of foam concentrate from which effective firefighting foams can be produced and these are described as follows: 
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <h2><li>Protein Foam</li></h2>
        <p>
            This consists primarily of protein hydrolysate, plus stabilizing additives and inhibitors to protect against freezing, to prevent corrosion of equipment and containers, to resist bacterial decomposition, to control viscosity, and to otherwise ensure readiness for use under emergency conditions. Current formulations are used at recommended nominal concentrations of 3, 5 and 6 percent by volume of the water discharge. All of these can be used to produce a suitable foam but the manufacturer of the foam-making equipment should be consulted as to the correct concentrate to be used in any particular system (the proportions installed must be properly designed and/or set for the concentrate being used). Foam liquids of different types or different manufacturers should not be mixed unless it is established that they are completely interchangeable and compatible. Where a dry chemical powder is to be used as the complementary agent in conjunction with protein foam it is essential to determine the compatibility of these agents for simultaneous application. Incompatibility will result in the destruction of the foam blanket in areas where the two agents are in contact. To ensure that the tank does not contain stale protein foam, the entire contents should be discharged periodically and the entire system washed through.
        </p>
        <h2><li>Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF)</li></h2>
        <p>
            There are many concentrates in this category consisting basically of a fluorinated surfactant with foam stabilizer. The Concentrates may, according to the specification, be used in solutions up to 6 per cent, with appropriate proportioning systems, or in premixed solutions. It is essential in selecting a concentrate to ensure that it is suitable for use in the total system incorporated in a RFF vehicle. It is also important to discuss with the manufacturer or supplier the use of an AFFF concentrate in extremes of temperature or where salt or brackish water may be used in the solution, with particular regard to any possibility of interaction between the tank structure, any surface treatment or the associated plumbing of the system. The foam produced acts to provide a barrier to exclude air or oxygen and, by the drainage of a chemically impregnated fluid from the foam, to provide a film on the fuel surface capable of containing fuel vapour. The foam produced does not have the density and visual appearance of foams produced from protein or fluoroprotein concentrates and training will be necessary to accustom fire fighters to its effectiveness as a fire suppressant. AFFF concentrates may be used in equipment normally used for protein or fluoroprotein foam production but conversion should not be undertaken without consultation with the manufacturer or supplier of the AFFF concentrate or RFF vehicle. A thorough flushing of the foam tank and the total foam-making system will be necessary before the introduction of the AFFF concentrate. Some changes in the foam-making systems of vehicles, particularly aspirating nozzles, where used, may be necessary to achieve the optimum properties of AFFF foams. The AFFF foams are compatible with all currently available dry chemical powder agents. Protein and fluoroprotein concentrates are incompatible with AFFF concentrates and they should not be mixed although foams produced from these concentrates, separately generated, may be applied to a fire in sequence or simultaneously. 
        </p>
        <h2><li>Fluoroprotein foam (conventional) </li></h2>
        <p>
            This foam contains a concentration of synthetic fluorinated surfactant giving better all around performance than ordinary protein foams, as well as providing resistance to breakdown by chemical powders. Current formulations are used at concentrations of 3 and 6 percent by volume of the water discharge. The manufacturer of the foam making equipment should be consulted as to the correct concentrate to be used in any particular system. (The proportioner used must be properly designed and/or set for the concentrate being used.) Foam liquids of different types or different manufacturer should not be mixed unless it is established that they are completely interchangeable and compatible. Compatibility of a foam produced by any proposed agent and system with a dry chemical powder agent is essential and should be established by a test programme although it is known that compatibility is a characteristic of most fluoroprotein foams
        </p>
        <h2><li>Film forming fluoroprotein (FFFP) foams </li></h2>
        <p>
            Film forming fluoroprotein (FFFP) agents are composed of protein together with film forming fluorinated surfactants, which make them capable of forming water solution films on the surface of flammable liquids and of adding oleophobic properties to the foam generated. This characteristic makes FFFP particularly effective where the foam may be contaminated with fuel (such as forceful application). Expanded foams generated from FFFP solutions have fast spreading characteristics and act as surface barriers to exclude air and prevent vaporization, thus suppressing combustible vapours. This film, which can spread over fuel surfaces not covered with foam, is self-sealing following mechanical disruption and continues as long as there remains a reservoir of foam for its production. To ensure extinction, however, an FFFP blanket should cover the fuel surface, as is the practice with other foams. This foam is highly effective on fuel spills because it is fluid, film forming and has oleophobic properties, Film forming fluoroprotein concentrates are available for proportioning to a final concentration of 3 to 6 per cent by volume using either fresh or sea water. They are compatible with dry chemical agents but this should be confirmed by a test programme. 
        </p>
        <h2><li>Synthetic foams </li></h2>
        <p>
            This foam contains primarily petroleum products - alkylsulphates, alkylsulphanates, alkylarylsulphanates, etc. Synthetic foam forming substances also include stabilizers, anti-corrosives, and components to control viscosity, freezing temperature and bacteriological decomposition. Concentrates of different types or from different manufacturers should not be mixed in order to obtain an extinguishing foam; however, synthetic foams from different pieces of equipment are compatible and can be used one after the other or simultaneously to extinguish a fire. The degree of compatibility between synthetic foams and dry (powder) chemical substances should be determined prior to their intended use. Fluorine and organohalogen free foams complying with Level A, B and C requirements may be available under the heading of synthetic foams. These particular products are less long term damaging to the environment and are stable against polar and non-polar hydrocarbons. Fluorine and organohalogen free firefighting foams are pseudo plastic materials containing surface active agents, polymer film formers, co-surfactants, stabilizers and anti-freeze compounds. Polymer film formers prevent the destruction of finished foam. These products can be used in concentrations up to 6%, with foam compatible dry powders and with aspirating and non-aspirating equipment.

        <p>There are some types of foam concentrate physical properties test: </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Expansion Ratio and Drainage time test </li>
            <li>pH Value Test </li>
            <li>Foam Viscosity </li>
            <li>Foam Viscosity </li>
            <li>Surface Tension Test </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Physical property tests often include laboratory measurements of parameters such as pH (acidity/alkalinity), viscosity, specific gravity, sediment and the effects of accelerated ageing. Standards generally contain well defined methods and equipment for the measurement of these properties. The results of these tests can be used to compare the properties of the foam concentrate with minimum/ maximum requirement limits set within standards or with previously tested foam concentrates.
