    <h2>Personal Protective Equipment</h2>
    <p>
        Designated equipment may be necessary, and personnel involved should receive any necessary additional training and be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        RFF personnel entering and working in an aircraft incident scene or impact area should be utilizing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and receive the appropriate level of decontamination immediately after their duties are completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The job nature of RFF personnel poses numerous potential hazards (Liveware vs. Environment). The risk of inhalation of carbon or smoke particles when extinguishing a fire, either during an incident or during training, is very high. Therefore, RFF services
        must provide all fire fighters with the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as self-containing breathing apparatus (SCBA), helmets, boots, protective clothing etc. In relation to day-to-day operations, the uniform worn by RFF
        personnel should also be of a suitable material depending on the local climate and conditions.

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Test Method A (Refractometer or Conductivity Meter) </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Foam Sampling Apparatus </li>
            <li>The foam sample collector shall be constructed as specified in Figure 3-3. </li>

            <li>The foam sample shall be collected in a standard 1000-mL-capacity graduated cylinder. The cylinder shall be cut off at the 1000-mL mark to ensure a fixed volume of foam as a sample. The cylinder shall be marked in 10-mL graduations below the
                100-mL mark. </li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <li>Test Procedure </li>
        <ol>
            <li>The empty weight of the foam sample container shall be recorded to the nearest gram on a balance having a maximum capacity sufficient to weigh the foam sample container and the foam sample. The foam sample collector shall then be located in
                the center of the discharge pattern determined in Section 6.5. The foam sample container shall be positioned at the bottom of the foam collector so that the foam hitting the collector flows into the container. The foam nozzle shall be
                aimed so that the foam deflects off the side of the foam collector, adjusted to its normal operating pressure, and then moved so as to discharge foam onto the foam sample collector. As soon as the foam sample container has been completely
                filled with foam, the discharge nozzle shall be shut off and the timing of the 25 percent drainage started. </li>
            <li>The foam sample container shall be removed from the base of the foam collector, excess foam struck off the top of the foam container using a straight edge, and any remaining foam wiped from the outside surface of the container. The container
                shall then be placed on the balance. The total weight of the foam sample and container shall be determined to the nearest gram. The weight of the foam sample in the container shall be determined by subtracting the weight of the empty container
                from the weight of the container filled with the foam. The weight of the foam sample in grams shall be divided by 4 to obtain the equivalent 25 percent drainage volume in milliliters. </li>
            <li>The foam sample container shall be placed on a level surface at a convenient height. At 30-second intervals, the level of accumulated solution in the bottom of the cylinder shall be noted and recorded. The drainage time versus the volume relationship
                shall be recorded until the 25 percent volume has been exceeded. The 25 percent drainage time shall then be interpolated from the data.</li>
            <li>Foam samples of the foam shall be weighed to the nearest gram. The expansion of the foam shall be calculated by the following equation: </li>

            <li>The empty weight of the foam sample container shall be recorded to the nearest gram on a balance having a maximum capacity sufficient to weigh the foam sample container, on a suitable support, and the foam sample. The foam sample collector
                shall then be located in the center of the discharge pattern determined in Section 2.2.2 point 9) of module 3. The foam sample container shall be positioned at the bottom of the foam collector so that the foam hitting the collector will
                flow into the container. The foam nozzle shall be aimed so that the foam deflects off the side of the foam collector, adjusted to its normal operating pressure, and then moved so as to discharge foam onto the foam sample collector. As
                soon as the foam sample container has been completely filled with foam, the discharge nozzle shall be shut off and the timing of the 25 percent drainage started. </li>
            <li>The foam sample container shall be removed from the base of the foam collector, excess foam struck off the top of the foam container using a straight edge, and any remaining foam wiped from the outside surface of the container. The container
                shall then be placed on the balance. The total weight of the foam sample and container shall be determined to the nearest gram. The weight of the foam sample in the container shall be determined by subtracting the weight of the empty container
                from the weight of the container filled with the foam. The weight of the foam sample in grams shall be divided by 4 to obtain the equivalent 25 percent drainage volume in milliliters. </li>
            <li>The foam sample container shall then be placed on a suitable support and a graduated cylinder placed below the drain spout. At 30-second intervals, the accumulated solution in the bottom of the foam sample container shall be drawn off into
                the graduated cylinder and the amount recorded. If the expected expansion ratio is more than 5:1, then a 100-mL graduated cylinder shall be used to collect the drainage; if the expected expansion ratio is 5:1 or less, then a 250-mL graduated
                cylinder shall be used. </li>
            <li>Foam samples shall be weighed to the nearest gram. The expansion of the foam shall be calculated by the following equation: </li>
