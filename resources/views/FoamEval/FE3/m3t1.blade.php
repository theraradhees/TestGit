    <h1>ARFF Vehicle Foam Production Performance Test</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It is essential that the foam produced by an RFF vehicle, or other such appliance, is of an acceptable quality and the delivery parameters such as monitor jet range and pattern meet and are maintained to the appropriate operational requirement. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Foam Production Performance Test should confirm the following: 
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The induction percentage for all foam-making devices. </li>
        <li>The expansion ratio from all foam making devices.</li>
        <li>The quarter drainage time from all foam making devices. </li>
        <li>The jet range of the main monitor. </li>
        <li>The spray pattern of the main monitor </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        ICAO recommends that the ARFF Vehicle Foam Production Performance Test should be conducted; 
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>once a year (annually)</li>
        <li>When a RFF vehicle is first acquired by the licence holder for operational use at an aerodrome. </li>
        <li>When significant maintenance, refurbishment or component replacement has been undertaken on a RFF vehicle that could affect a change in the foam quality or production performance of the foam-making system. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Local regulation (KP 605 Th 2015) - semiannually, and the result should be reported to airport authority; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Anytime when necessary if any inspection/audit.

    <h2>Method A (Refractometer or Conductivity Meter)</h2>
    <p>
        A calibration curve shall be prepared using the following apparatus and procedure. 
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>apparatus</li>
        <p>In preparing the calibration curve, the following apparatus shall be used: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Three 100-mL graduates </li>
            <li>One measuring pipette (10-ml capacity) </li>
            <li>One 100-mL breaker </li>
            <li>One 500-mL breaker </li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <li>Procedure </li>
        <p>
            Using water and foam concentrate from the tanks of the vehicle to be tested, three standard solutions shall be made up by pipe fitting, into three 100-mL graduated cylinders, volumes of foam concentrate in milliliters equal to the following: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The nominal concentration of the foam concentrate. </li>
            <li>One-third more than the nominal concentration of the foam concentrate. </li>
            <li>One-third less than the nominal concentration of the foam concentrate. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The graduated cylinders shall then be filled to the 100-mL mark with water. After thoroughly mixing, a refractive index reading shall be taken of each standard. A plot shall be made on graph paper of the scale reading against the known foam solution concentrates and shall serve as a calibration curve for this particular series of foam tests. 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Test Sample Concentration </li>
        <p>
            Portions of solution drained during the drainage test described in 2.2.2 point 9) in module 2. shall be used as a source of test sample for the concentration determination. Refractive index or conductivity readings of the test sample shall be compared to the calibration curve and the corresponding foam solution concentration read from the graph.
        </p>
    </ol>

    <h2>Method B (Refractometer Only) </h2>
    <p>A calculation shall be made using the following apparatus and procedure. </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Apparatus</li>
        <p>The concentration determination shall be made using the following apparatus: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Three clean plastic or glass containers </li>
            <li>One dropper or pipette </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Procedure</li>
        <p>
            Using water and foam concentrate from the tanks of the vehicle to be tested, sample concentrations shall be determined as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain a foam concentrate sample in a clean container and label “foam concentrate.” </li>
            <li>Obtain a water sample from the truck water tank or pump water discharge in a second clean container and label “water.” </li>
            <li>Allow foam solution to discharge from a hoseline or turret for at least 30 seconds. Obtain a foam solution sample from the discharge device in a third clean container and label “foam solution.” The portions of drained solution obtained during the drainage test described in 2.2.2 point 9) in module 2. Can be used for the “foam solution” sample. </li>
            <li>Take a refractive index reading for the water sample. Record the reading as Rw. </li>
            <li>Clean the instrument. </li>
            <li>Repeat step (4) with foam concentrate. Record the reading as Rc. </li>
            <li>Clean the instrument. </li>
            <li>Repeat step (4) with foam solution. Record the reading as Rs. </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Determine the foam concentration of the foam solution sample by calculating the following formula using the readings obtained in steps (4), (6), and (8) above:</li>
