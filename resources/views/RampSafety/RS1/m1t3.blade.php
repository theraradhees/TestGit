<h2>
    Appreciate Need for Having PPE
</h2>
<p>
    Hazards exist in every workplace in many different forms: sharp edges, falling objects, flying sparks, chemicals, noise and a myriad of other potentially dangerous situations. When an injury occurs in the workplace, not only does the worker suffer but the costs-medical and time loss payments, loss in productivity, costs for a replacement worker, and potential increase in insurance premium costs can be great. Personal protective equipment must be selected to protect against any hazard that is present or likely to be present. It is important for the workers to become familiar with the potential hazards, the type of protective equipment that is available, and the level of protection that is provided by that equipment, i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Eye and Face Protection </h2>
<p>
    Eye and face protection must be used where a hazard exists due to any of the following: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flying Objects or Particles;</li>
    <li>Molten Metal;</li>
    <li>Liquid chemicals;</li>
    <li>Harmful contacts;</li>
    <li>Exposures;</li>
    <li>Acids or caustic chemicals; </li>
    <li>Chemical gases or vapors; </li>
    <li>Glare;</li>
    <li>Air Contaminants;</li>
    <li>Radiation;</li>
    <li>Electrical flash;</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As shown in figure 1.9, type of eye and face protection.

<br>
<h2>Head Protection</h2>
<p>
    Head protection, as shown in figure 1.10, must be used when a hazard exists due to any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Impact and penetration of falling objects</li>
    <li>Impact when working in low clearance areas; </li>
    <li>High voltage electric shock and burns;</li>
    <li>Flying objects;</li>
    <li>Electric shock;</li>
    <li>Hair entanglement ; </li>
    <li>Chemicals; </li>
    <li>Temperature extremes; </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hearing Protection</h2>
<h3>Types of Hearing Protectors</h3>
<p>
    Thereâ€™s a wide variety of types of hearing protectors available, including ear muffs, foam and preformed ear plugs, and canal caps. Selection is based upon several factors, as described below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ear Muffs - These devices fit against the head and enclose the entire external ears. The inside of the muff cup is lined with an acoustic foam which can reduce noise by as much as 15 to 30 decibels. Ear muffs are often used in conjunction with ear plugs to protect the employee from extremely load noises, usually at or above 105 decibels. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Ear Plugs - Preformed ear plugs come in different sizes to fit different sizes of ear canals. Formable or foam ear plugs, if placed in the ear correctly, will expand to fill the ear canal and seal against the walls. This allows foam ear plugs to fit ear canals of different sizes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Canal Caps - As the name implies, these devices cap off the ear canal at its opening. They generally provide less protection than ear muffs or plugs. 
        <p> These devices are not recommended for use by the EHSC. </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Choosing a Hearing Protector</h3>
<p>
    Choosing the right hearing protector depends upon several factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Good seal: sound reduction is dependent upon blocking any air leakage which will allow sound to bypass the hearing protector and enter the ear. For this reason, the hearing protector must fit properly whether over the ear or in the ear.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comfort: Both comfort and convenience are important if the device is to be used consistently. The ease of placing and removing the device, as well as environmental factors such as the presence of dirt or chemicals must be considered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication: Hearing protectors often make communication difficult by reducing and distorting sounds. Employees who are hearing-impaired who must receive detailed face to face instruction may prefer ear muffs so that they can lift up the muffs to hear speech. 
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Foot Protection</h2>
<p>
    Select protective footwear when employees work in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, objects piercing the sole, and where employees' feet are exposed to electrical hazards. Examples of situations that may require the use of protective footwear include: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Handling heavy objects and/or tools that could be dropped; </li>
    <li>Work activities involving manual material handling carts, heavy pipes, or bulk rolls, all of which could potentially roll over an employee's feet; </li>
    <li>Work involving sharp objects such as nails, tacks, large staples, scrap metal, etc., which could penetrate the sole of the shoe;</li>
    <li>Work involving explosive materials such as black powder, volatile substances, cotton dust, grain dust that could be ignited by the discharge of static electricity; </li>
    <li>Work with electrical hazards; </li>
    <li>Work with electronic components. </li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><b>Figure 1.11, Type of Foot Protection: a) safety shoes, b) boots</b></p>
<br>
<h2>Hand Protection</h2>
<p>
    Select and use the appropriate hand protection when employees' hands may be potentially exposed to the following hazard sources: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skin absorption of harmful substances </li>
    <li>Severe cuts or lacerations </li>
    <li>Severe abrasions </li>
    <li>Punctures</li>
    <li>Chemical burns</li>
    <li>Irritating materials</li>
    <li>Thermal burns</li>
    <li>Harmful temperature extremes</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is important to select appropriate gloves (as shown in figure 1.12) for a particular application and to determine how long the glove can be worn, and whether it can be reused. Cloth gloves must not be worn when operating rotating equipment such as a drill or powered threading machine. 
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Figure 1.12 Type of Gloves: a) Metal Mesh Gloves, b) Vinyl and neoprene gloves, c) Leather gloves, d) Rubber Gloves, e) Padded cloth gloves, f) Heat resistant gloves, g) Latex disposable gloves, h) Lead-lined gloves </b></p>
<br>
<p>
    Type of hand protection i.e. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gloves</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Metal mesh gloves: resist sharp edges and prevent cuts; </li>
        <li>Leather gloves: shield your hands from rough surfaces; </li>
        <i>Vinyl and neoprene gloves: protect your hands against toxic chemicals; </i>
        <li>Rubber gloves: protect you when working around electricity; </li>
        <li>Padded cloth gloves: protect your hands from sharp edges, slivers, dirt, and vibration; </li>
        <li>Heat resistant gloves: protect your hands from heat and flames;</li>
        <li>Latex disposable gloves: used to protect your hands from germs and bacteria; </li>
        <li>Lead-lined gloves: used to protect your hands from radiation sources. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Body Prote4ction</h2>
<p>
    Body protection should be worn when there is a possibility of bodily injury from hazards while performing their jobs. 
</p>
<p>
    Workplace hazards include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intense Heat</li>
    <li>Splashes of hot metals and other hot liquids </li>
    <li>
        Impacts from tools, machinery and materials
    </li>
    <li>Cuts</li>
    <li>Hazardous chemicals</li>
    <li>contact with potentially infectious materials, like blood(refer to the Biosafety Manual for PPE guidelines)</li>
    <li>Radiant energy (ultraviolet, visible, infrared)</li>
    <i>Motor vehicle traffic</i>
</ul>
<p>
    Protective clothing needs to be provided only for the specific parts of the body that are exposed to the hazard. Depending on the hazards of the workplace one or more of the following may need to be provided: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vests</li>
    <li>Jackets</li>
    <li>Aprons</li>
    <li>Coveralls</li>
    <li>Sleeve protectors </li>
    <li>Surgical gowns</li>
    <li>Full body suits</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Serviceability of Safety Equipment </h2>
<p>
    The personal protective equipment selected must fit the employee it is intended to protect. Make certain that employees have the correct size of protective equipment. Whenever possible, select adjustable personal protective equipment. Employee input in the selection process is critical. Personal protective equipment hat fits properly and is comfortable will more likely be worn by employees. Damaged or defective protective equipment must be taken out of service immediately to be repaired or replaced and employees must be provided with the proper equipment in the interim. 
</p>
<p>
    As appropriate, ramp personnel should wear safety footwear, gloves, knee pads. High visibility clothing, toilet-servicing and wet and winter weather gear, sun hats, sunglasses, earmuffs, and sunscreen. High visibility clothing should be mandatory on the ramp. Clothing should fit snugly to prevent becoming snagged.
