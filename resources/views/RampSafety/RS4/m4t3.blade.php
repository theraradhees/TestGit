  <h1>Abnormal Situation (Aerodrome Emergency) Responses </h1>
  <hr>

  <p>
    An aerodrome emergency is an actual or imminent occurrence, which may endanger the safety or health of any person or may destroy or damage property. There are many possible emergency situations at an airport however those emergencies specifically involving aircraft are defined by two categories, which determine the level of response required. These categories are: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full emergency: </li>
    <p>
      A situation declared by either the Pilot in Command or Air Traffic Control, when it is known that an aircraft approaching the airport is, or is suspected to be, in such trouble that there is danger of an accident requiring the response from off-airport agencies. An Airport Emergency Plan activation is required for response to this situation and will involved participation from all agencies. 
    </p>
    <li>Local Standby:</li>
    <p>
      A situation declared by either the Pilot or Command or Air Traffic Control to be initiated when an aircraft approaching the airport is known or is suspected to have developed some defect but the trouble is not such as would normally involve any serious difficulty in effecting a safe landing. Airport Emergency Plan activation is required for respond to this situation however it usually only involves airport-based agencies. 
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Airport emergencies include the following events: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal injuries </li>
    <li>Damage to aircraft </li>
    <li>Vehicle accidents </li>
    <li>Damage to airport infrastructure</li>
    <li>Fuel, oil or hazardous material spills</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using portable fire extinguisher </h2>
  <p><i>[www.wikihow.com]</i></p>
  <h3>Call For Help Before Attempting To Extinguish A Serious Fire.</h3>
  <p>
    The fire may take hold much faster than you're capable of dealing with it, and if help is on the way, it removes one less concern for you.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Call, or have someone else call, 911 in North America, 999 in the United Kingdom, 112 in the European Union and many other countries (or the appropriate emergency number for your country) as soon as possible. Ask for the fire service to come immediately, giving your address and a brief description of the type of fire. </li>
    <li>Check that all other people are out of the house and have them remove pets as well. Check that they're all assembled at a safe meeting point. Do not allow children to attempt to use a fire extinguisher or control a fire in any respect whatsoever. </li>
    <li>Realize that reacting to a fire requires a sound process of decision-making that children and some adults may not be capable of coping with their panic. Prior training on correct use can alleviate some of the concern here.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Check For Your Own Safety Before Starting To Extinguish A Fire. </h3>
  <p>There are some key things to check for before you start fighting a fire using a fire extinguisher: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you physically capable of extinguishing a fire? Some people have physical limitations that might diminish or eliminate their ability to properly use a fire extinguisher. People with disabilities, older adults, or children may find that an extinguisher is too heavy to handle or it may be too difficult for them to exert the necessary pressure to operate the extinguisher. </li>
    <li>Look for your exit points. Ensure that there is a clear exit for immediate escape should this becomes necessary. At all times, keep your mind focused on the availability of a safe retreat. If this is threatened at all, leave at once. The US National Fire Prevention Association recommends that you install fire extinguishers close to an exit point, to enable you to keep your back to the exit when you use the extinguisher; this ensures that you can make an easy escape if the fire cannot be controlled. </li>
    <li>Do not attempt to put out a fire where it is emitting toxic smoke; if you suspect or simply don't know if the smoke is toxic, leave it to the professionals </li>
    <li>Check for structural safety of the building, in case burning walls, floors, or rafters pose a risk to your safety. </li>
    <li>If you have more than one fire extinguisher, consider asking another mature and responsible person to use it in tandem with you. </li>
    <li>Remember that your life is more important than property, so don't place yourself or others at risk. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>See Figure 1</p>
  <p style="text-align: center"><b> Figure 1</b></p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Assess the Fire.</h3>
  <p>
    Only a contained fire should be fought using a fire extinguisher. Portable fire extinguishers are valuable for immediate use on small fires because they contain a limited amount of extinguishing material, which needs to be used properly or it will be wasted. For example, when a pan initially catches fire, it may be safe to turn off the burner, place a lid on the pan, and use an extinguisher. By the time the fire has spread, however, these actions will not be adequate, and only trained firefighters can safely extinguish such fires. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a quick commonsense assessment about the utility and safety of using a fire extinguisher for the fire you're experiencing. Obviously, a fire extinguisher is overkill for a candle but it's useless when the whole house is on fire. A fire in a wastepaper basket, however, is another suitable candidate for fire extinguisher use. </li>
    <li>Use your instincts. If your instincts tell you the fire's too dangerous to tackle, trust them. </li>
    <p></p>
  </ul>
  <h3>Check the Type of Extinguisher</h3>
  <p>
  In the USA, there are five main classes of fire extinguisher (note that the classes and nomenclature can vary from country to country): A, B, C, and the less common classes D and K. The extinguishing agent might be water, dry chemical, halon, CO2, or a special powder. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b> Class A: </b> This is suitable for cloth, wood, rubber, paper, various plastics, and regular combustible fires. It is usually filled with 2 1/2 gallons (9.46 liters) of pressurized water. </li>
    <li><b>Class B: </b> This is suitable for grease, gasoline or oil-based fires is usually filled with a dry chemical. Extinguishers smaller than 6lbs (2.72kg) are not recommended. </li>
    <li><b> Class C: </b> This is suitable for electrical fires caused by appliances, tools, and other plugged in gear. It can contain either halon or CO2. Halon 1211 and 1301 is very expensive and depletes the ozone layer, but it is being replaced by non-depleting agents such as FM200. Note that halon is now illegal in numerous jurisdictions. </li>
    <li><b>Class D: </b> This is used for water-reactive metals such as burning magnesium and will be located in factories using such metals. It comes in the form of a powder that must cover the material to extinguish it.</li>
    <li><b>Class K: </b> This contains a special purpose wet chemical agent for use in kitchen fires and deep fryers to stop fires started by vegetable oils, animal fats, or other fats started in cooking appliances.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Note that many fire extinguishers will work on a combination of fire classes. You'll need to decide quickly on what type of fire you have and ensure that your fire extinguisher is compatible with the fire you are attempting to extinguish. An all-purpose ABC dry chemical (10lb/4.5kg) extinguisher is a safe bet for most fires, especially where you're not sure of the fire's origins. 
  </p>
  <h3>Ready The Fire Extinguisher. </h3>
  <p>
  Almost all fire extinguishers have a safety pin in the handle. This pin usually looks like a plastic or metal ring, sometimes colored red that is held in place by a plastic seal. The distinctive features will vary depending on the type of fire extinguisher you have. You must break the seal and pull the safety pin from the handle before you can use the fire extinguisher by squeezing the lever, which discharges the fire extinguishing agent. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It helps if you ensure that you're familiar with how your fire extinguisher works before being placed under pressure; take time to read over its instructions after you've read this article. Familiarize yourself with its special features and parts. Different extinguishers rely on different methods of use: be aware of this in advance of having to use them. 
  </p>
  <h3>Aim for the Base of The Fire.</h3>
  <p>
  Shooting into the flame is a waste of the fire extinguisher, as you're not putting out the source of the flames. It's vital to stop the fire at its source, or to remove or dampen the fuel from the fire, in order to put it out. By focusing the extinguisher's spray at the base of the fire or the source, you're extinguishing the fuel.
  </p>
  <h3>Remember The Simple Acronym P.A.S.S. </h3>
  <p>
    P.A.S.S to help you use the fire extinguisher effectively.P.A.S.S. stands for: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep, explained below the printable diagram. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull the safety pin from the handle. The pin is located at the top of the fire extinguisher. Once removed, it releases the locking mechanism, allowing you to discharge the extinguisher.</li>
    <li>Aim the extinguisher nozzle or hose at the base of the fire. As explained, this removes the source or fuel of the fire. Keep yourself low. </li>
    <li>Squeeze the handle or lever slowly to discharge the agent. Letting go of the handle will stop the discharge, so keep it held down. </li>
    <li>Sweep side to side approximately 6in or 15cm over the fire until expended. The sweeping motion helps to extinguish the fire. Stand several feet or meters back from the fire: fire extinguishers are manufactured for use from a distance. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The fire may flare up somewhat as extinguishing begins due to the flames being pushed away from the burning material (the real target) by the agent and gust of propellant. Do not be alarmed so long as it dies back promptly. 
  </p>
  <h3>Be aware that the typical fire extinguisher will contain around 10 seconds of extinguishing power. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the extinguisher has already been discharged partially, this time will be less. </li>
    <li>If the fire doesn't respond well after you've used up the fire extinguisher, remove yourself to safety quickly. </li>
    <li>If the room fills with smoke, make a hasty exit</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Tend to the area if you have successfully put out the fire.</h3>
  <p>
    This means not leaving it alone, as it might re-ignite without warning. If it is safe to do so, remove fuel sources and commence cleaning up. Water can be used to ensure there are no remaining sparks in materials that are safe to extinguish with water (most combustibles other than oils and other insoluble combustible liquids or places involving electricity). The fire department could help you ensure the fire is completely extinguished. If you're legally obliged to report fires to local authorities, then do so, especially if filing for an insurance claim.

  <h2>Light Gun Signals</h2>
  <p><i>[www.faa.gov/go/runwaysafety] </i></p>
  <p>
    Air traffic controllers have a backup system for communicating if radios fail. Controllers use a light gun that flashes different colors to tell pilots or vehicle drivers what to do. Even a failed radio is not an excuse for proceeding without a proper clearance. If you are on a runway or taxiway and radio communication fails, you should:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn toward the tower. </li>
    <li>Flash your lights several times. </li>
    <li>Wait for the controller to signal you with the light gun. </li>
    <li>Be patient for a response. If the controller’s attention is diverted, it may take a few minutes for a response. If your radios are working, try a frequency other than ground. </li>
    <li>Call the tower on your cell phone if you have the number available. </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: center"><b>Figure 3. Light Gun Signals</b></p>

  <h2>Bad Weather</h2>
  <p><i>[www.nata.aero]</i></p>
  <P>Thunder and lightning: </P>
  <P>If the sound of thunder is less than 25 seconds after the lightning flash, go inside immediately. </P>
  <P>Formula for estimating the proximity of an approaching thunderstorm: 5 seconds of elapsed time between the lightning flash and the sound of thunder = 1 mile. </P>
  <br>
  <h2>Spillage</h2>
  <p>
    Fuel, oil, solvents, paint, adhesives, detergents, herbicides and pesticides, amongst other things, are all classified as Dangerous Goods or Hazardous Substances and are potentially dangerous or harmful to human health and the environment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Poor storage, handling and disposal of these products not only create a risk to human health, it can also cause environmental (soil, air and water) pollution. The cost to clean up environmental pollution can be extremely expensive. Prevention of spills is the first step in avoiding risk to human health and the environment. An effective response and good management of the spills that do occur is vital if risks to human health and environmental pollution are to be avoided or minimized.
  </p>
  <h3>Spill Response Equipment </h3>
  <p>
    All operators on airport are required to maintain sufficient response equipment to manage the type and size of spill that may occur at their premises, or in association with their work. There is a variety of spill response equipment. The type and quantity of fuel, oil and chemicals you use and store at your facility will determine the type and quantity of spill response equipment you require. Spill response material designed to target specific substances is commercially available. For example absorbent mats and booms designed to absorb fuel, oil and allow water to pass through is available. 
  </p>
  <p>Spill Response Equipment can include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Absorbent Booms and Mats </li>
    <li> Granules </li>
    <li> Storm water Drain Caps </li>
    <li>Portable Bunds </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In facilities where small amounts (<20L) of Dangerous Goods and Chemicals are used and stored, absorbent substances such as chemisorb or saw dust are sufficient for spill response. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Procedure in Event Of Spillage </h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  This procedure applies to all spillage including aviation fuel, hydraulic oil, and chemical. The general procedure are: 
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Fuel spillage covering an area of approximately 4 m2 or more constitutes a hazard and should be brought to the immediate attention of the Airport Emergency Service; </li>
    <li>Do not drive through the spill liquid. Report spill to Apron Control Centre and Airport Emergency Service;</li>
    <li>Do not start engine of motorized equipment within spill areas until it is cleaned up (fuel spill in case).; </li>
    <li>Cordon off the spillage area; </li>
    <li>Divert road traffic; </li>
    <li>No vehicle/ground equipment shall be permitted to come within 15 meters of the spillage area (fuel spill in case). </li>
    <li>Clean up the spillage if only it is safe to do so, apply absorbent material to absorb the spill, sweep up the residue and place in container for disposal. </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Foreign Object Debris (FOD)</h2>
  <p>
    Foreign Object Debris (FOD), FOD is any object, live or not, located in an inappropriate location in the airport environment that has the capacity to injure airport or air carrier personnel and damage aircraft. Facilities and ramp area must be kept clean if we are to avoid FOD caused personal injury, which can result in lost wage or even permanent disability or aircraft damage that can cause flights to be late or canceled. 
  </p>
  <p>
    FOD includes a wide range of material, including loose hardware, pavement fragments, catering supplies, building materials, rocks, sand, pieces of luggage, and even wildlife. FOD is found at terminal gates, cargo aprons, taxiways, runways, and run-up pads. It causes damage through direct contact with airplanes, such as by cutting airplane tires or being ingested into engines, or as a result of being thrown by jet blast and damaging airplanes or injuring people. 
  </p>
  <h3>FOD Prevention </h3>
  <p>
    FOD Prevention is your responsibility. Effective Foreign Object Debris (FOD) prevention requires your daily attention to these very important procedure: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Checking the ramp and gate areas for cleanliness and deterioration. </li>
    <li>Checking ground equipment and parking area for cleanliness</li>
    <li>Ensure there are no loose parts on ground equipment that could fall. </li>
    <li>Ensure that working area are clear of Foreign Object Debris (FOD).</li>
  </ul>
