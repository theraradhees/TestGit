  <h2>General</h2>
  <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines dangerous goods as: </p>
  <p>
      “Articles or substances which are capable of posing a risk to health, safety, property or the environment and which are shown in the list of dangerous goods in the Technical Instructions or which are classified according to those Instructions.”
  </p>
  <p>
      (ICAO <i>Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air)</i>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      Many items and substances can be dangerous when transported by air. Due to the variations in temperature and pressure during a flight, some of these items may leak or break, generating toxic fumes or possibly starting a fire. Employees who may come into
      contact with dangerous goods need to be aware of the nature of such goods, their potential for causing incidents and accidents and how they should be dealt with.
  </p>
  <p>
      The authorities allow dangerous goods to be transported by air transport, because there is a commercial demand for many products classified as dangerous goods, such as paints, batteries, goods that must be kept refrigerated for a considerable time and
      etc. Sometimes air transport is only way to reach remote places.
  </p>
  <p>
      More importantly, if the risk can be identified then it may be eliminated as a result the safely air transport can be achieved. The risk can be reduced by full compliance with the regulations. Each dangerous goods must be identified by a proper shipping
      name (PSN) that will be found in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR).
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Dangerous Goods Classification </h2>
  <p>
      Not all dangerous goods have the same risk, the regulation divide dangerous goods into 9 classes reflecting the type of risk involved. In some cases these classes are further sub divided into division to identify a particular risk, within that class.
  </p>
  <p>
      Classes are expressed by single digit number, for example class 4. Divisions are expressed by two digit number, for example flammable solids is class 4, division 1, and is referred to as “Division 4.1”.
  </p>
  <p>
      Each class or division has specific criteria that are used to determine whether an article or substance belongs to that class or division. These classes are:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Class 1 : Explosives; </li>
      <li>Class 2 : Gases;</li>
      <li>Class 3 : Flammable Liquids; </li>
      <li>Class 4 : Flammable Solids; substances liable to spontaneous Combustion; substances which in contact with water emit flammable gases; </li>
      <li>Class 5 : Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides; </li>
      <li>Class 6 : Toxic and infectious substances;</li>
      <li>Class 7 : Radioactive material;</li>
      <li>Class 8 : Corrosives; </li>
      <li>Class 9 : Miscellaneous dangerous goods. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Classes Description</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Class 1 - Explosives; </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Class 2.1 Flammable gases</li>
      <p>
          Flammable gases can be ignited in air. They may be lighter or heavier than air. Heavier than air gases can collect in low lying areas such as pits, depressions, and drains causing a fire and explosion hazard. Examples include: liquefied petroleum gas
          (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, and acetylene.
      </p>
      <li>Class 2.2 - Non-flammable, non-toxic gases:</li>
      <p>
          are neither flammable nor toxic. Examples include: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, compressed air, and helium.
      </p>
      <li>Class 2.2 - Non-flammable, non-toxic gases sub-risk 5.1 (Oxidizing gases):</li>
      <p>
          These gases, although not flammable, can accelerate combustion and increase the risk of fire in the presence of combustible or flammable materials. Examples include: nitrous oxide, entonox, and nitrous oxide.
      </p>
      <li>Class 2.3 - Toxic gases: </li>
      <p>
          on inhalation these may cause death or injury. Many of these also have other properties (e.g. may be flammable, oxidizing or corrosive). Class 2.3 is never used as a subsidiary risk. If a material meets the criteria it will be classified as a toxic gas.
          Examples of toxic gases include: anhydrous ammonia, methyl bromide, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.
      </p>
      <li>Class 3 - Flammable Liquids : </li>
      <p>
          produce vapor that can be ignited in air on contact with a suitable ignition source. Such as: unleaded petrol (ULP), xylene, kerosene, and acetone.
      </p>
      <li>Class 4.1 - Flammable Solids</li>
      <p>
          these materials are easily ignited and may cause fire through friction heat or other ignition sources. Examples include: red phosphorous, hexamine, naphthalene, and camphor.
      </p>
      <li>Class 4.2</li>
      <p>
          Substances that in contact with water emit flammable gases: On contact with water these materials can become spontaneously combustible or liberate flammable or toxic gases. Examples include: aluminum phosphide (liberates phosphine gas), calcium carbide
          (liberates acetylene on contact with water), and sodium.
      </p>
      <li>Class 5.1 - Oxidizing agents: </li>
      <p>
          these substances can contribute/accelerate the combustion of other combustible or flammable materials. Examples include: ammonium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, calcium hypochlorite.
      </p>
      <li>Class 6.1 - Toxic substances: </li>
      <p>
          These materials comprise substances liable to cause death or serious injury or harm from inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin. Some toxic materials may have other sub-risks (e.g. flammable or corrosive). Examples include: paraquat, endosulfan,
          arsenic compounds, cyanide, toluene di-isocyanate (TDI), and many pesticides.
      </p>
      <li>Class 7 - Radioactive Substances</li>
      <p>
          Radioactive substances comprise substances or a combination of substances which emit ionizing radiation <u>(uranium, plutonium).</u>
      </p>
      <li>Class 8 - Corrosive substances:</li>
      <p>
          corrosive materials are capable of causing the degradation and destruction of living tissue, steel and other materials on contact. Some may give off irritating vapors affecting the eyes, airways and skin. Corrosive material may possess other properties
          (e.g. flammability or oxidation). Corrosive materials are either acids or bases/alkalis. Examples of acids include: nitric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, lead acid batteries.
      </p>
      <li>Class 9 - Miscellaneous dangerous goods:</li>
      <p>
          This class comprises substances and articles that present a danger not offered by other classes. Some of the materials may be assigned to this class based on temperature properties (e.g. elevated temperature products). Examples of class 9 goods include:
          dry ice, asbestos, and molten bitumen.
      </p>
  </ul>
  <h2>Dangerous Goods Emergency Response </h2>
  <p>
      General procedures for ramp personnel.
  </p>
  <p>
      Airport authorities and operators must have established emergency procedure that incorporate provisions for the handling of spills of dangerous goods or other unidentified substances. The applicable local and company emergency response procedures and
      the relevant emergency contact telephone number must be made available to all employees.
  </p>
  <p>
      General emergency procedure in the event of spill or leakage involving dangerous goods are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Notify immediate supervisor first; </li>
      <li>Identify the dangerous goods (if safe to do so); </li>
      <li>Where safe to do so, isolate the package by removing other packages or property; </li>
      <li>Avoid contact with the content of the package; </li>
      <li>If the content come in contact with your body or clothes: </li>
      <ul>
          <li>thoroughly wash off body with plenty of water, </li>
          <li>remove contaminated clothing, </li>
          <li>do not eat or smoke, </li>
          <li>keep hands away from eyes, mouth and nose, </li>
          <li>seek medical assistance. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Staff involved in such incidents should stay on site until their names are noted. </li>
  </ul>
