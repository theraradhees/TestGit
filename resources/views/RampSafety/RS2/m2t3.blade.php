        Risk management is the identification, analysis and elimination (and/or mitigation to an acceptable or tolerable level) of those hazards, as well as the subsequent risks, that threaten the viability of an organization.‚Äù (ICAO Doc 9859).
    </p>
    <p>
        The complete elimination of risk in aviation operations obviously is an unachievable and impractical goal (being perfectly safe means to stop all aviation activities and to ground all aircraft). As not all risks can be removed, nor are all possible risk
        mitigation measures economically practical. In other words, it is accepted that there will be some residual risk of harm to people, property or environment, but this is considered to be acceptable or tolerable by the responsible authority and
        the society.
    </p>
    <p>
        Risk management, being a central component of the SMS, plays vital role in addressing the risk in practical terms. It requires a coherent and consistent process of objective analysis, in particular for evaluating the operational risks. In general, Risk
        Management is a structured approach and systematic actions aimed to achieve the balance between the identified and assessed risk and practicable risk mitigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Risk management consists of three essential elements:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hazard identification</li>
        <p>
            Identification of undesired or adverse events that can lead to the occurrence of a hazard and the analysis of mechanisms by which these events may occur and cause harm. Both reactive and proactive methods and techniques should be used for hazard identification.
        </p>
        <li>
            Risk Assessment
        </li>
        <p>
            Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to the hazard. Identified hazards are assessed in terms of criticality of their harmful effect and ranked in order of their risk-bearing potential. They are assessed often by experienced personnel,
            or by utilizing more formal techniques and through analytical expertise. The severity of consequences and the likelihood (frequency) of occurrence of hazards are determined. If the risk is considered acceptable, operation continues without
            any intervention, if it is not acceptable, risk mitigation process is engaged.

        <li>Risk Mitigation</li>
        <p>
            If the risk is considered to be unacceptable, then control measures are taken to fortify and increase the level of differences against that risk or to avoid or remove the risk, if this is economically feasible.

        <p><b>Risk Mitigation - Example</b></p>
        <p>
            The use of safety marker cones is one of the examples of risk mitigation. Safety cones are caution sign for drivers to maintain required safety clearances. Cones protect parts of the aircraft against collision by GSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            The placements of safety marker cones are as follows:
