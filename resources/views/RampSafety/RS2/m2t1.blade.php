    <h2>
        Aerodrome Layout
    </h2>
    <p>
        An aerodrome is a defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure and surface movement of aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the area within the aerodrome are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Maneuvering area. That part of an aerodrome to be used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding aprons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Maneuvering area. That part of an aerodrome to be used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding aprons.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Apron
    </h2>
    <p>
        Maneuvering area. That part of an aerodrome to be used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding aprons.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Equipment Restraint Area &amp; Equipment Restraint Line</h2>
    <p>
        The Equipment Restraint Area (ERA) is defined as the area of the apron bordered by a red line known as the Equipment Restraint Line–or otherwise indicated–in which an aircraft is parked during ground operations.

    <h2>Aerodrome Marking and Sign</h2>
    <p>
        There are markings and signs used at aerodromes, which provide directions and assist pilots and ramp operation personnel (especially drivers)in aerodrome operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Marking</h3>
    <p>
        Marking is a symbol or group of symbols displayed on the surface of the movement area in order to convey aero-nautical information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different markings are used to identify different areas of the aerodrome. All airside users must be familiar with the airside markings. There are 3 (three) common markings are discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the most common markings and signs are discussed.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Runway Markings</li>
        <p>
            Runway markings shall be white. Runway markings vary depending on the type of operations conducted at the airport. Figure 1-2shows a runway that is approved as a precision instrument approach runway and some other common runway markings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since aircraft are affected by the wind during takeoffs and landings, runways are laid out according to the local prevailing winds. Runway numbers are in reference to magnetic north. Certain airports have two or even three runways laid out in the same
            direction. These are referred to as parallel runways and are distinguished by a letter added to the runway number (e.g., runway 36L (left), 36C (center), and 36R (right)).
        </p>

        <li>Taxiway Markings</li>
        <p>
            Aircraft use taxiways to transition from parking areas to the runway. Taxiways are identified by a continuous yellow center line stripe and may include edge markings to define the edge of the taxiway. This is usually done when the taxiway edge does not
            correspond with the edge of the pavement. If an edge marking is a continuous line, the paved shoulder is not intended to be used by an aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is a dashed marking, an aircraft may use that portion of the pavement. Where a taxiway approaches a runway, there may be a holding position marker. These consist of four yellow lines (two solid and two dashed). The solid lines are where the aircraft
            is to hold. At some towered airports, holding position markings may be found on a runway.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something to remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is always permissible to cross from the dashed side to the solid side
            </li>
            <li>ATC permission is always required to cross from the solid side to the dashed side at an aerodrome with an operating control tower</li>
            <li>
                When instructed to “Hold Short” always stop prior to first solid line of the runway holding position marking.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <li>Other Markings</li>
        <p>
            Some other markings found on the airport include vehicle roadway markings, VOR receiver checkpoint markings, and non-movement area boundary markings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vehicle roadway markings are used when necessary to define a pathway for vehicle crossing areas that are also intended for aircraft. These markings usually consist of a solid white line to delineate each edge of the roadway and a dashed line to separate
            lanes within the edges of the roadway. In lieu of the solid lines, zipper markings may be used to delineate the edges of the vehicle roadway. [Figure 1-4]

    <h3>Sign</h3>
    <p>
        There are six types of signs that may be found at airports. The more complex the layout of an airport, the more important the signs become to pilots. Figure 1-5 shows examples of signs, their purpose, and appropriate pilot action. The six types of signs
        are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mandatory instruction signs—red background with white inscription. These signs denote an entrance to a runway, critical area, or prohibited area.
        </li>
        <li>
            Location signs—black with yellow inscription and a yellow border, no arrows. They are used to identify a taxiway or runway location, to identify the boundary of the runway, or identify an instrument landing system (ILS) critical area.
        </li>
        <li>
            Direction signs—yellow background with black inscription. The inscription identifies the designation of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of an intersection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Destination signs—yellow background with black inscription and also contain arrows. These signs provide information on locating things, such as runways, terminals, cargo areas, and civil aviation areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            Information signs—yellow background with black inscription. These signs are used to provide the pilot with information on such things as areas that cannot be seen from the control tower, applicable radio frequencies, and noise abatement procedures. The
            airport operator determines the need, size, and location of these signs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Runway distance remaining signs—black background with white numbers. The numbers indicate the distance of the remaining runway in thousands of feet.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Lighting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Runway Light</li>
        <p>
            All runways licensed for night use must have lighting which at least defines the extent of the runway. This is referred to as Edge Lighting, Threshold Lighting and Runway End Lighting. Other types of lighting may also be provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            ICAO guidance requires that Runway lighting shall not be operated if a runway is not in use for landing, take-off or taxiing purposes, unless such operation is required for runway inspection or maintenance purposes. ATC are required to use whatever means
            are available to them to ensure that they are aware of any lighting system unserviceability so that appropriate notification action can be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various lights that identify parts of the runway complex. Minimum Runway Lighting are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Runway Edge Lights are Omni-directional and are located along or just beyond the edges of the area declared for use as the runway as defined by edge markings and are white subject to certain specific exceptions. The area defined may not necessarily
                be the maximum width of the paved runway surface. The lights may be either elevated or embedded in the surface. If a landing threshold is displaced, but the pre-landing threshold area is available for takeoff, then the edge lights between
                the beginning of the runway surface and the displaced threshold will be split so as to show red up to the landing threshold whilst still showing white after that point. If a runway ‘starter extension’ is provided which is narrower than
                its associated runway, then blue edge lighting may be used to mark its edges.</li>
            <li>
                Runway Threshold Lights are provided in a line along the landing threshold at the touchdown end of a runway and define the beginning of the declared Landing Distances. They are green and can only be seen from the approach.
            </li>
            <li>
                Runway End Lights are provided in a line along the end of the runway available for use. They are red and can only be seen in the direction of runway use.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Taxiway Light
        </li>
        <p>
            Omnidirectional taxiway lights outline the edges of the taxiway and are blue in color. At many airports, these edge lights may have variable intensity settings that may be adjusted by an air traffic controller when deemed necessary or when requested by
            the pilot. Some airports also have taxiway centerline lights that are green in color.
        </p>
