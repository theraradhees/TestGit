<h2>Strayed Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Strayed aircraft</li>
    <p>
        An aircraft which has deviated significantly from its intended track or which reports that it is lost. VFR flights encountering adverse meteorological conditions
    </p>
    <li>Unidentified aircraft</li>
    <p>
        An aircraft which has been observed or reported to be operating in a given area but whose identity has not been established.
    </p>
    <li>If the aircraft’s position is not known, the air traffic services unit shall:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>attempt to establish two-way communication with the aircraft, unless such communication already exists;</li>
        <li>use all available means to determine its position;</li>
        <li>inform other ATS units into whose area the aircraft may have strayed or may stray, taking into account all the factors which may have affected the navigation of the aircraft in the circumstances;</li>
        <li>inform, in accordance with locally agreed procedures, appropriate military units and provide them with pertinent flight plan and other data concerning the strayed aircraft;</li>
        <li>request from the units referred to points above and from other aircraft in flight every assistance in establishing communication with the aircraft and determining its position.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>When the aircraft’s position is established, the air traffic services unit shall:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>advise the aircraft of its position and corrective action to be taken; and</li>
        <li>provide, as necessary, other ATS units and appropriate military units with relevant information concerning the strayed aircraft and any advice given to that aircraft.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>As soon as an air traffic services unit becomes aware of an unidentified aircraft in its area, it shall endeavour to establish the identity of the aircraft whenever this is necessary for the provision of air traffic services or required by the appropriate
        military authorities in accordance with locally agreed procedures. To this end, the air traffic services unit shall take such of the following steps as are appropriate in the circumstances:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>attempt to establish two-way communication with the aircraft;</li>
        <li>inquire of other air traffic services units within the FIR about the flight and request their assistance in establishing two-way communication with the aircraft;</li>
        <li>inquire of air traffic services units serving the adjacent FIRs about the flight and request their assistance in establishing two-way communication with the aircraft;</li>
        <li>attempt to obtain information from other aircraft in the area.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>The air traffic services unit shall, as necessary, inform the appropriate military unit as soon as the identity of the aircraft has been established.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Should the ATS unit consider that a strayed or unidentified aircraft may be the subject of unlawful interference, the appropriate authority designated by the State shall immediately be informed, in accordance with locally agreed procedures.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Weather deviation procedures</h2>
<p>
    The following procedures are intended for deviations around adverse meteorological conditions.
</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>When the pilot initiates communications with ATC, a rapid response may be obtained by stating “WEATHER DEVIATION REQUIRED” to indicate that priority is desired on the frequency and for ATC response. When necessary, the pilot should initiate the communications
        using the urgency call “PAN PAN” (preferably spoken three times).aircraft flight conditions;</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>The pilot shall inform ATC when weather deviation is no longer required, or when a weather deviation has been completed and the aircraft has returned to its cleared route.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Actions to be taken when controller-pilot communications are established ATC should take one of the following actions:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>when appropriate separation can be applied, issue clearance to deviate from track; or</li>
        <li>if there is conflicting traffic and ATC is unable to establish appropriate separation, ATC shall:</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>advise the pilot of inability to issue clearance for the requested deviation;</li>
            <li>advise the pilot of conflicting traffic; and</li>
            <li>request the pilot’s intentions.</li>

        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Actions to be taken if a revised ATC clearance cannot be obtained</li>
    <p>
        If the aircraft is required to deviate from track to avoid adverse meteorological conditions and prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. Until an ATC clearance is received, the pilot shall
        take the following actions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>if possible, deviate away from an organized track or route system;</li>
        <li>establish communications with and alert nearby aircraft by broadcasting, at suitable intervals: aircraft identification, flight level, position (including ATS route designator or the track code) and intentions, on the frequency in use and on 121.5
            MHz (or, as a backup, on the inter-pilot air-to-air frequency 123.45 MHz);</li>
        <li>watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS (if equipped);</li>
        <li>turn on all aircraft exterior lights (commensurate with appropriate operating limitations);</li>
        <li>for deviations of less than 19 km (10 NM) remain at a level assigned by ATC;</li>
        <li>for deviations greater than 19 km (10 NM), when the aircraft is approximately 19 km (10 NM) from track, initiate a level change in accordance with Table below;</li>
        <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Table3.1 level change</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: center"><strong><img src="https://www.trainairplus.id/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/796716546/Table%203.1%20level%20change%20%281%29.png" alt="" role="presentation"><br></strong></p>
        <li>when returning to track, be at its assigned flight level when the aircraft is within approximately 19 km (10 NM) of the centre line; and</li>
        <li>if contact was not established prior to deviating, continue to attempt to contact ATC to obtain a clearance. If contact was established, continue to keep ATC advised of intentions and obtain essential traffic information.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Interception of civil aircraft</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>As soon as an air traffic services unit learns that an aircraft is being intercepted in its area of responsibility, it shall take such of the following steps as are appropriate in the circumstances:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>attempt to establish two-way communication with the intercepted aircraft via any means available, including the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz, unless such communication already exists;</li>
        <li>inform the pilot of the intercepted aircraft of the interception;</li>
        <li>establish contact with the intercept control unit maintaining two-way communication with the intercepting aircraft and provide it with available information concerning the aircraft;</li>
        <li>relay messages between the intercepting aircraft or the intercept control unit and the intercepted aircraft, as necessary;</li>
        <li>in close coordination with the intercept control unit take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the intercepted aircraft; and</li>
        <li>inform ATS units serving adjacent FIRs if it appears that the aircraft has strayed from such adjacent FIRs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>As soon as an air traffic services unit learns that an aircraft is being intercepted outside its area of responsibility, it shall take such of the following steps as are appropriate in the circumstances:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Inform the ATS unit serving the airspace in which the interception is taking place, providing this unit with available information that will assist in identifying the aircraft and requesting it to take action in accordance with 1.3.1</li>
        <li>Relay messages between the intercepted aircraft and the appropriate ATS unit, the intercept control unit or the intercepting aircraft.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Fuel Dumping</h2>
<ol>
    <li>An aircraft in an emergency or other urgent situations may need to dump fuel so as to reduce to maximum landing mass in order to effect a safe landing.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>When an aircraft operating within controlled airspace needs to dump fuel, the flight crew shall advise ATC. The ATC unit should then coordinate with the flight crew the following:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>the route to be flown, which, if possible, should be clear of cities and towns, preferably over water and away from areas where thunderstorms have been reported or are expected;</li>
        <li>the level to be used, which should be not less than 1800 m (6000 ft); and</li>
        <li>the duration of the fuel dumping.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>Other known traffic should be separated from the aircraft dumping fuel by:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>at least 19 km (10 NM) horizontally, but not behind the aircraft dumping fuel;</li>
        <li>vertical separation if behind the aircraft dumping fuel within 15 minutes flying time or a distance of 93 km (50 NM) by:</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>at least 300 m (1 000 ft) if above the aircraft dumping fuel; and</li>
            <li>at least 900 m (3 000 ft) if below the aircraft dumping fuel.</li>
            <p>
                <i>The horizontal boundaries of the area within which other traffic requires appropriate vertical separation extend for 19 km (10 NM) either side of the track flown by the aircraft which is dumping fuel, from 19 km (10 NM) ahead, to 93 km (50 NM) or 15 minutes along track behind it (including turns).</i>
            </p>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>A warning message shall be broadcast on appropriate frequencies for non-controlled traffic to remain clear of the area concerned. Adjacent ATC units and control sectors should be informed of the fuel dumping taking place and requested to broadcast
        on applicable frequencies an appropriate warning message for other traffic to remain clear of the area concerned. </li>
    <p>Upon completion of the fuel dumping, adjacent ATC units and control sectors should be advised that normal operations can be resumed.</p>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Unauthorized use of ATC frequency</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Instances of false and deceptive transmissions on ATC frequencies which may impair the safety of aircraft can occasionally occur. In the event of such occurrences, the ATC unit concerned should:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>correct any false or deceptive instructions or clearances which have been transmitted;</li>
        <li>advise all aircraft on the affected frequency(ies) that false and deceptive instructions or clearances are being transmitted;</li>
        <li>instruct all aircraft on the affected frequency(ies) to verify instructions and clearances before taking action to comply;</li>
        <li>if practical, instruct aircraft to change to another frequency; and</li>
        <li>if possible, advise all aircraft affected when the false and deceptive instructions or clearances are no longer being transmitted.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>Flight crews shall challenge or verify with the ATC unit concerned any instruction or clearance issued to them which they suspect may be false or deceptive.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>When the transmission of false or deceptive instructions and clearances is detected, the appropriate authority shall take all necessary action to have the transmitter located and the transmission terminated.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Blocked frequency</h2>
<p>In the event that the control frequency is inadvertently blocked by an aircraft transmitter, the following additional steps should be taken:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>attempt to identify the aircraft concerned;</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>if the aircraft blocking the frequency is identified, attempts should be made to establish communication with that aircraft, e.g. on the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz, by SELCAL, through the aircraft operator’s company frequency if applicable, on
        any VHF frequency designated for air-to-air use by flight crews or any other communication means or, if the aircraft is on the ground, by direct contact;</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>if communication is established with the aircraft concerned, the flight crew shall be instructed to take immediate action to stop inadvertent transmissions on the affected control frequency.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Change of radiotelephony call sign for aircraft</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>An ATC unit may instruct an aircraft to change its type of RTF call sign, in the interests of safety, when similarity between two or more aircraft RTF call signs are such that confusion is likely to occur.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Any such change to the type of call sign shall be temporary and shall be applicable only within the airspace(s) where the confusion is likely to occur.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Procedures in regard to aircraft equipped with Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS)</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>The procedures to be applied for the provision of air traffic services to aircraft equipped with ACAS shall be identical to those applicable to non-ACAS equipped aircraft. In particular, the prevention of collisions, the establishment of appropriate
        separation and the information which might be provided in relation to conflicting traffic and to possible avoiding action shall conform with the normal ATS procedures and shall exclude consideration of aircraft capabilities dependent on ACAS equipment.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>When a pilot reports an ACAS resolution advisory (RA), the controller shall not attempt to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports “Clear of Conflict”.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Once an aircraft departs from its ATC clearance or instruction in compliance with an RA, or a pilot reports an RA, the controller ceases to be responsible for providing separation between that aircraft and any other aircraft affected as a direct consequence
        of the manoeuvre induced by the RA. The controller shall resume responsibility for providing separation for all the affected aircraft when:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft has resumed the current clearance; or</li>
        <li>the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft is resuming the current clearance and issues an alternative clearance which is acknowledged by the flight crew.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>Following a significant ACAS event, pilots and controllers should complete an air traffic incident report.</li>
</ol>
<br>
