    <h2>Ground radio failure</h2>
    <p>In the event of complete failure of the ground radio equipment used for ATC, the controller shall:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>where aircraft are required to keep a listening watch on the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz, attempt to establish radio communications on that frequency;</li>
        <li>without delay inform all adjacent control positions or ATC units, as applicable, of the failure;</li>
        <li>appraise such positions or units of the current traffic situation;</li>
        <li>if practicable, request their assistance, in respect of aircraft which may establish communications with those positions or units, in establishing separation between and maintaining control of such aircraft; and</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>In the event of complete failure of the ground radio equipment used for control, the controller shall, unless able to continue to provide the ATS surveillance service by means of other available communication channels, proceed as follows:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>without delay inform all adjacent control positions or ATC units, as applicable, of the failure;</li>
        <li>apprise such positions or units of the current traffic situation;</li>
        <li>request their assistance, in respect of aircraft which may establish communications with those positions or units, in establishing and maintaining separation between such aircraft; and</li>
        <li>instruct adjacent control positions or ATC units to hold or re-route all controlled flights outside the area of responsibility of the position or ATC unit that has experienced the failure until such time that the provision of normal services can be resumed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In order to reduce the impact of complete ground radio equipment failure on the safety of air traffic, the appropriate ATS authority should establish contingency procedures to be followed by control positions and ATC units in the event of such failures. Where feasible and practicable, such contingency procedures should provide for the delegation of control to an adjacent control position or ATC unit in order to permit a minimum level of services to be provided as soon as possible, following the ground radio failure and until normal operations can be resumed.

    <h2>Air – Ground communication failure</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Action by air traffic control units when unable to maintain two-way communication with an aircraft operating in a control area or control zone shall be as outlined in the paragraphs which follow.</li><p></p>
        <li>As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, action shall be taken to ascertain whether the aircraft is able to receive transmissions from the air traffic control unit by requesting it to execute a specified manoeuvre which can be observed by an ATS surveillance system or to transmit, if possible, a specified signal in order to indicate acknowledgement. Note.— Some aircraft equipped with first generation ADS-B avionics do not have the capability of squawking IDENT while the emergency and/or urgency mode is selected.</li><p></p>
        <li>If the aircraft fails to indicate that it is able to receive and acknowledge transmissions, separation shall be maintained between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft, based on the assumption that the aircraft will:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>if in visual meteorological conditions:</li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>continue to fly in visual meteorological conditions;</li>
                <li>land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and</li>
                <li>report its arrival by the most expeditious means to the appropriate air traffic control unit; or</li>
            </ol>
            <li>if in instrument meteorological conditions or when conditions are such that it does not appear likely that the pilot will complete the flight in accordance with 1):</li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement, in airspace where procedural separation is being applied, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes following the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; or</li>
                <li>in airspace where an ATS surveillance system is used in the provision of air traffic control, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or</li>
                    <li>the time the transponder is set to Code 7600 or the ADS-B transmitter is set to indicate the loss of air-ground communications; or</li>
                    <li>the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point;</li>
                </ul>
                <li>when being vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset using RNAV without a specified limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude;</li>
                <li>proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or fix serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with v), hold over this aid or fix until commencement of descent;</li>
                <li>commence descent from the navigation aid or fix specified in iv) at, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged; or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;</li>
                <li>complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or fix;</li>
                <li>land, if possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in 5) or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.</li>
                <p>Note 1.— Provisions related to minimum levels are contained in Annex 2, 5.1.2.</p>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <li>Action taken to ensure suitable separation shall cease to be based on the assumption stated in point c (above) when:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>it is determined that the aircraft is following a procedure differing from that in point c (above); or</li>
            <li>through the use of electronic or other aids, air traffic control units determine that action differing from that required by c may be taken without impairing safety; or</li>
            <li>positive information is received that the aircraft has landed.</li>
        </ol><p></p>
        <li>As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, appropriate information describing the action taken by the air traffic control unit, or instructions justified by any emergency situation, shall be transmitted blind for the attention of the aircraft concerned, on the frequencies available on which the aircraft is believed to be listening, including the voice frequencies of available radio navigation or approach aids. Information shall also be given concerning:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>meteorological conditions favorable to a cloud-breaking procedure in areas where congested traffic may be avoided; and</li>
            <li>meteorological conditions at suitable aerodromes.</li>
        </ol><p></p>
        <li>Pertinent information shall be given to other aircraft in the vicinity of the presumed position of the aircraft experiencing the failure.</li><p></p>
        <li>As soon as it is known that an aircraft which is operating in its area of responsibility is experiencing an apparent radiocommunication failure, an air traffic services unit shall forward information concerning the radiocommunication failure to all air traffic services units concerned along the route of flight. The ACC in whose area the destination aerodrome is located shall take steps to obtain information on the alternate aerodrome(s) and other relevant information specified in the filed flight plan, if such information is not available.</li><p></p>
        <li>If circumstances indicate that a controlled flight experiencing a communication failure might proceed to (one of) the alternate aerodrome(s) specified in the filed flight plan, the air traffic control unit(s) serving the alternate aerodrome(s) and any other air traffic control units that might be affected by a possible diversion shall be informed of the circumstances of the failure and requested to attempt to establish communication with the aircraft at a time when the aircraft could possibly be within communication range. This shall apply particularly when, by agreement with the operator or a designated representative, a clearance has been transmitted blind to the aircraft concerned to proceed to an alternate aerodrome, or when meteorological conditions at the aerodrome of intended landing are such that a diversion to an alternate is considered likely.</li><p></p>
        <li>When an air traffic control unit receives information that an aircraft, after experiencing a communication failure has re-established communication or has landed, that unit shall inform the air traffic services unit in whose area the aircraft was operating at the time the failure occurred, and other air traffic services units concerned along the route of flight, giving necessary information for the continuation of control if the aircraft is continuing in flight.</li><p></p>
        <li>If the aircraft has not reported within thirty minutes after:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>the estimated time of arrival furnished by the pilot;</li>
            <li>the estimated time of arrival calculated by the ACC; or</li>
            <li>the last acknowledged expected approach time,
                whichever is latest, pertinent information concerning the aircraft shall be forwarded to aircraft operators, or their designated representatives, and pilots-in-command of any aircraft concerned and normal control resumed if they so desire. It is the responsibility of the aircraft operators, or their designated representatives, and pilots-in-command of aircraft to determine whether they will resume normal operations or take other action.</li>
