    <hr>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Air traffic services personnel shall be prepared to recognize any indication of the occurrence of unlawful interference with an aircraft.</li><p></p>
        <li>Whenever unlawful interference with an aircraft is suspected, and where automatic distinct display of SSR Mode A Code 7500 and Code 7700 is not provided, the controller shall attempt to verify any suspicion by setting the SSR decoder to Mode A Code 7500 and thereafter to Code 7700.</li><p></p>
        <li>Note - An aircraft equipped with an SSR transponder is expected to operate the transponder on Mode A Code 7500 to indicate specifically that it is the subject of unlawful interference. The aircraft may operate the transponder on Mode A Code 7700, to indicate that it is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires immediate assistance. An aircraft equipped with other surveillance system transmitters, including ADS-B and ADS-C, might send the emergency and/or urgency signal by all of the available means.</li><p></p>
        <li>Whenever unlawful interference with an aircraft is known or suspected or a bomb threat warning has been received, ATS units shall promptly attend to requests by, or to anticipated needs of, the aircraft, including requests for relevant information relating to air navigation facilities, procedures and services along the route of flight and at any aerodrome of intended landing, and shall take such action as is necessary to expedite the conduct of all phases of the flight.</li><p></p>
        <li>ATS units shall also:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>transmit, and continue to transmit, information pertinent to the safe conduct of the flight, without expecting a reply from the aircraft;</li>
            <li>monitor and plot the progress of the flight with the means available, and coordinate transfer of control with adjacent ATS units without requiring transmissions or other responses from the aircraft, unless communication with the aircraft remains normal;</li>
            <li>inform, and continue to keep informed, appropriate ATS units, including those in adjacent FIRs, which may be concerned with the progress of the flight;</li>
            <li>Note - In applying this provision, account must be taken of all the factors which may affect the progress of the flight, including fuel endurance and the possibility of sudden changes in route and destination. The objective is to provide, as far in advance as is practicable in the circumstances, each ATS unit with appropriate information as to the expected or possible penetration of the aircraft into its area of responsibility.</li>
            <li>notify:</li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>the operator or its designated representative;</li>
                <li>the appropriate rescue coordination centre in accordance with appropriate alerting procedures;</li>
                <li>the appropriate authority designated by the State;</li>
                <p><i>Note.— It is assumed that the designated security authority and/or the operator will in turn notify other parties concerned in accordance with pre-established procedures.</i></p>
            </ol><p></p>
            <li>relay appropriate messages, relating to the circumstances associated with the unlawful interference, between the aircraft and designated authorities.</li>
            <p><i>Note.— These messages include, but are not limited to: initial messages declaring an incident; update messages on an existing incident; messages containing decisions made by appropriate decision makers; messages on transfer of responsibility; messages on acceptance of responsibility; messages indicating that an entity is no longer involved in an incident; and messages closing an incident.</i></p>
        </ol>
        <li>The following additional procedures shall apply if a threat is received indicating that a bomb or other explosive device has been placed on board a known aircraft. The ATS unit receiving the threat information shall:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>if in direct communication with the aircraft, advise the flight crew without delay of the threat and the circumstances surrounding the threat; or</li>
            <li>if not in direct communication with the aircraft, advise the flight crew by the most expeditious means through other ATS units or other channels.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <li>The ATS unit in communication with the aircraft shall ascertain the intentions of the flight crew and report those intentions to other ATS units which may be concerned with the flight.</li><p></p>
        <li>The aircraft shall be handled in the most expeditious manner while ensuring, to the extent possible, the safety of other aircraft and that personnel and ground installations are not put at risk.</li><p></p>
        <li>Aircraft in flight shall be given re-clearance to a requested new destination without delay. Any request by the flight crew to climb or descend for the purpose of equalizing or reducing the differential between the outside air pressure and the cabin air pressure shall be approved as soon as possible.</li><p></p>
        <li>An aircraft on the ground should be advised to remain as far away from other aircraft and installations as possible and, if appropriate, to vacate the runway. The aircraft should be instructed to taxi to a designated or isolated parking area in accordance with local instructions. Should the flight crew disembark passengers and crew immediately, other aircraft, vehicles and personnel should be kept at a safe distance from the threatened aircraft.</li><p></p>
        <li>ATS units shall not provide any advice or suggestions concerning action to be taken by the flight crew in relation to an explosive device.</li><p></p>
        <li>An aircraft known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference or which for other reasons needs isolation from normal aerodrome activities shall be cleared to the designated isolated parking position. Where such an isolated parking position has not been designated, or if the designated position is not available, the aircraft shall be cleared to a position within the area or areas selected by prior agreement with the aerodrome authority. The taxi clearance shall specify the taxi route to be followed to the parking position. This route shall be selected with a view to minimizing any security risks to the public, other aircraft and installations at the aerodrome.</li>
