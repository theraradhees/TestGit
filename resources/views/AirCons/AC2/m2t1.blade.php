        <li>When authorized by the appropriate ATS authority, separation based on the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) and/or Multilateration MLAT, and/or Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) position
            symbols and/or PSR blips shall be applied so that the distance between the centres of the position symbols and/or PSR blips, representing the positions of the aircraft concerned, is never less than a prescribed minimum.</li>

        <li>Separation based on the use of PSR blips and SSR responses shall be applied so that the distance between the centre of the PSR blip and the nearest edge of the SSR response (or centre, when authorized by the appropriate ATS authority) is never

        <li>n the event that the controller has been notified of a controlled flight entering or about to enter the airspace within which the separation minima specified in separation minima based on ATS surveillance systems is applied, but has not identified
            the aircraft, the controller may, if so prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority, continue to provide an ATS surveillance service to identified aircraft provided that:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>reasonable assurance exists that the unidentified controlled flight will be identified using SSR and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT or the flight is being operated by an aircraft of a type which may be expected to give an adequate return on primary
                radar in the airspace within which the separation is applied; and</li>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>The vertical separation minimum (VSM) shall be:</li>
        <li>within designated airspace, subject to a regional air navigation agreement: a nominal 300 m (1 000 ft) below FL 410 or a higher level where so prescribed for use under specified conditions, and a nominal 600 m (2 000 ft) at or above this level.
            </li>

    <h2>Longitudinal separation in a surveillance environment </h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The separation minima specified in separation minima based on ATS surveillance systems may be applied between an aircraft taking off and a preceding departing aircraft or other identified traffic provided there is reasonable assurance that the
            departing aircraft will be identified within 2 km (1 NM) from the end of the runway, and that, at the time, the required separation will exist.</li>
        <li>The separation minima specified in separation minima based on ATS surveillance systems shall not be applied between aircraft holding over the same holding fix. Application of ATS surveillance system separation minima based on radar and/or ADS-B
            and/or MLAT systems between holding aircraft and other flights shall be subject to requirements and procedures prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority.</li>
        <li>Speed control</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In order to facilitate a safe and orderly flow of traffic, aircraft may, subject to conditions specified by the appropriate authority, be instructed to adjust speed in a specified manner. Flight crews should be given adequate notice of planned
                speed control.</li>
            <p>Note 1.— Application of speed control over a long period of time may affect aircraft fuel reserves.</p>
            <p>Note 2.— Provisions concerning longitudinal separation using the Mach number technique are contained in Chapter 5, Separation Methods and Minima.</p>
            <li>Speed control instructions shall remain in effect unless explicitly cancelled or amended by the controller.</li>
            <p>Note.— Cancellation of any speed control instruction does not relieve the flight crew of compliance with speed limitations associated with airspace classifications as specified in Annex 11 — Air Traffic Services, Appendix 4.</p>
            <li>Speed control shall not be applied to aircraft entering or established in a holding pattern.</li>
            <li>Speed adjustments should be limited to those necessary to establish and/or maintain a desired separation minimum or spacing. Instructions involving frequent changes of speed, including alternate speed increases and decreases, should be avoided</li>
            <li>The flight crew shall inform the ATC unit concerned if at any time they are unable to comply with a speed instruction. In such cases, the controller shall apply an alternative method to achieve the desired spacing between the aircraft concerned</li>
            <li>At levels at or above 7 600 m (FL 250), speed adjustments should be expressed in multiples of 0.01 Mach; at levels below 7 600 m (FL 250), speed adjustments should be expressed in multiples of 20 km/h (10 kt) based on indicated airspeed (IAS)</li>
            <li>Note 1.— Mach 0.01 equals approximately 11 km/h (6 kt) IAS at higher flight levels. Note 2.— When an aircraft is heavily loaded and at a high level, its ability to change speed may, in cases, be very limited.</li>

    <h2>Separation based on ATS surveillance systems </h2>

        <p>2.4.1.1. Unless otherwise prescribed in accordance with 2.4.1.2, 2.4.1.3 or 2.4.1.4, or Chapter 6 (with respect to independent and dependent parallel approaches), the horizontal separation minimum based on radar and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT systems
            shall be 9.3 km (5.0 NM). </p>
        <p>
            2.4.1.2. The separation minimum in 2.4.1.1 may, if so prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority, be reduced, but not below:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>5.6 km (3.0 NM) when radar and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT system's capabilities at a given location so permit; and </li>
            <li>4.6 km (2.5 NM) between succeeding aircraft which are established on the same final approach track within 18.5 km (10 NM) of the runway threshold. A reduced separation minimum of 4.6 km (2.5 NM) may be applied, provided: </li>
        </ol>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>the average runway occupancy time of landing aircraft is proven, by means such as data collection and statistical analysis and methods based on a theoretical model, not to exceed 50 seconds; </li>
            <li>braking action is reported as good and runway occupancy times are not adversely affected by runway contaminants such as slush, snow or ice; </li>
            <li>an ATS surveillance system with appropriate azimuth and range resolution and an update rate of 5 seconds or less is used in combination with suitable displays; </li>
            <li>the aerodrome controller is able to observe, visually or by means of surface movement radar (SMR), MLAT system or a surface movement guidance and control system (SMGCS), the runway-in-use and associated exit and entry taxiways; </li>
            <li>distance-based wake turbulence separation minima in 8.7.3.4, or as may be prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority (e.g. for specific aircraft types), do not apply; vi) aircraft approach speeds are closely monitored by the controller and
                when necessary adjusted so as to ensure that separation is not reduced below the minimum; vii) aircraft operators and pilots have been made fully aware of the need to exit the runway in an expeditious manner whenever the reduced separation
                minimum on final approach is applied; and viii) procedures concerning the application of the reduced minimum are published in AIPs.</li>

        <p>
            2.4.1.3 The separation minimum or minima based on radar and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT systems to be applied shall be prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority according to the capability of the particular ATS surveillance system or sensor to accurately identify
            the aircraft position in relation to the centre of a position symbol, PSR blip, SSR response and taking into account factors which may affect the accuracy of the ATS surveillance system-derived information, such as aircraft range from the
            radar site and the range scale of the situation display in use.
